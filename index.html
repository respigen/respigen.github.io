If you're here you probably want to see my <a href="/projects">projects</a> but my <a href="/articles">articles</a> are cool too.

<h2>Why do you do your projects?</h2>
<p>
I've probably found out I need something for myself that doesn't exist (or doesn't exist perfectly as I imagine it), or express the skills I have atomicall. Maybe I'm just trying to upskill. Each project has a write-up attached with decisions I've made along the way.
</p>
<h2>Why do you write articles?</h2>
<p>
Either I've forgotten something and remembered it again enough times to try archive it, or I've ranted at a coworker/friend about the same subject enough times that I've decided to write it down.
